This project provides a comprehensive exploration of deep learning for dental image classification. It includes the training and evaluation of multiple models, from a custom CNN to a fine-tuned ResNet50, and culminates in an interactive web application built with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

### ‚ú® Live Demo App

A live web application was built to provide an interactive interface for the best-performing model (Fine-Tuned ResNet50). Users can upload a dental image and receive an instant classification.

*(**Suggestion:** Create a short GIF of you using your Streamlit app and place it here. It's very impressive for a portfolio! You can use a tool like LICEcap or ScreenToGif.)*

## üìã Project Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately classify images of human teeth into distinct categories. The model is trained on a dataset of dental images and can identify classes such as 'CaS', 'CoS', 'Gum', 'MC', etc. The project systematically evaluates different deep learning strategies to identify the most effective approach.

### Key Features
*   **Multiple Model Architectures:** Comparison of a custom CNN, Transfer Learning (ResNet50), and Fine-Tuning.
*   **Data Augmentation:** Implementation of RandomFlip, RandomRotation, and RandomZoom to create a more robust model.
*   **Callbacks:** Use of EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau for efficient training.
*   **In-depth Evaluation:** Detailed performance analysis using accuracy, loss, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
*   **Interactive Web Interface:** A user-friendly Streamlit app to test the final model with any image.
*   **Reproducible Workflow:** A Jupyter Notebook (`Teeth_Classification.ipynb`) contains all the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The model was trained on the "Teeth Dataset", which is organized into three subsets: Training, Validation, and Testing. The dataset contains **7 classes** of dental images.

- **Training Set**: 3087 images
- **Validation Set**: 1028 images
- **Test Set**: 1028 images

### How to Get the Data

You can download the dataset directly from Google Drive.

## üíæ Pre-Trained Models

To run the Streamlit app or test the models without the need for training, you can download the final saved model files directly.

*   **[Download Trained Models from Google Drive]((https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I3n33bTc3MnHK0MwXHdaVfquowedMu8q))**

**Instructions for the Streamlit App:**
1.  Download the files from the link above.
2.  Find the best-performing model: `teeth_classification_model_with_FineTune.keras`.
3.  Place this `.keras` file inside the `Streamlit_App/` folder in your local repository. The app is configured to load the model from this location.

## üöÄ Model Performance & Results

The models were trained and evaluated on their ability to classify images from the test set. The fine-tuned ResNet50 model achieved the best performance, demonstrating the power of adapting pre-trained models to specific domains.

| Model                               | Test Accuracy | Test Loss |
| ----------------------------------- | :-----------: | :-------: |
| Custom CNN (No Augmentation)        |    55.06%     |   1.3454  |
| Custom CNN (With Augmentation)      |    88.62%     |   0.3489  |
| Transfer Learning - Xception        |    81.61%     |   0.5640  |
| Transfer Learning - ResNet50        |    90.27%     |   0.3466  |
| **Fine-Tuned - ResNet50**           |  **~99.51%**  | **~0.0121** |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

There are two main parts to this project: running the interactive demo app and re-training the models.

### 1. Running the Interactive Streamlit App

This is the quickest way to see the project in action.

**Prerequisites:**
*   You must have the trained model file `teeth_classification_model_with_FineTune.keras` inside the `Streamlit_App` folder. You can generate this by running the Jupyter Notebook first.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MohanadMetrash/teeth-classification-deep-learning.git
    cd teeth-classification-deep-learning
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the app directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Streamlit_App
    ```

4.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your web browser will open with the application running locally.
